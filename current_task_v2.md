<think>The user is asking me to help them create a roadmap for cleaning up their codebase, specifically separating the concepts of "agents" from "nodes" on a canvas. Based on the attached README.md and the conversation shared, I understand that:

1. They have a platform called "Agent Platform" which is a full-stack application with a Rust/WASM frontend, FastAPI/OpenAI backend.
2. They started with a concept where "nodes" on a canvas represent "agents", but now want to separate these concerns.
3. They want agents to exist independently of the canvas/node representation.
4. In the future, they want to have a canvas view for workflows where multiple agents can be placed on the canvas and represented by nodes with coordinates.
5. The issue is about separation of concerns and making the code more modular and maintainable.

To help create a roadmap, I should first examine their codebase to understand the current structure and how agents and nodes are currently implemented. Then I can provide a step-by-step plan for refactoring.

Let me start by exploring the codebase structure to understand what files and directories exist.</think>I'll help you create a roadmap for separating agents from nodes in your codebase. Let's start by examining the current structure to understand how things are organized.

Let's look at the frontend structure first to understand the Rust/WASM code:

Ran tool
Now let's check the backend structure:

Ran tool
Let's look at the backend's main code structure:

Let's check the structure of the canvas module in the frontend:

Now, let's look at some key files to understand how agents and nodes are currently defined. First, let's look at the state.rs file since it's quite large and likely contains our agent/node definitions:

Read file: frontend/src/state.rs
Now, let's look at the models.rs file to understand the data structures:

Read file: frontend/src/models.rs
Let's also look at a part of the update.rs file to understand how the state is updated:

Read file: frontend/src/update.rs
Now, let's check the messages.rs file to understand the message types:

Read file: frontend/src/messages.rs
Let's also check the backend code to understand how agents are handled server-side:

Read file: backend/zerg/main.py
Let's also check the agents router in the backend:

Ran tool

Read file: backend/zerg/app/routers/agents.py
Now, let's examine the database schemas to understand how agents are defined:

Ran tool

Read file: backend/zerg/app/schemas/schemas.py
Based on my exploration of your codebase, I have a good understanding of how your system is currently structured and the challenges you're facing with the separation of agents and nodes. Here's a high-level roadmap for cleaning up your code:

# Roadmap for Separating Agents from Nodes

## Phase 1: Clear Domain Separation (Current State Analysis)

I can see you've already started moving in the right direction. Your models.rs file shows a clear separation between:
- `ApiAgent` (pure agent domain model) 
- `CanvasNode` (visual representation with x,y coordinates and optional agent_id)
- `Node` (legacy model that combines both concepts)

You also have separate HashMaps in your AppState:
```rust
pub nodes: HashMap<String, Node>,  // Legacy structure
pub agents: HashMap<u32, ApiAgent>, // Agent domain data
pub canvas_nodes: HashMap<String, CanvasNode>, // Visual representation
```

### 1.1 Complete Inventory of Agent vs Node Code (1-2 days)
- Create a full inventory of every function that operates on the legacy `Node` structure
- Categorize each function as either "agent logic" or "visualization logic"
- Identify where these concerns are mixed

## Phase 2: Backend Refactoring (2-3 days)

The backend already has a clean separation with:
- Clear Agent data models in schemas.py
- RESTful endpoints for agent operations in agents.py
- No canvas/visualization concepts in the backend

### 2.1 Ensure Complete Backend API (1 day)
- Verify all agent operations are possible via API without requiring UI
- Add any missing endpoints if needed
- Document all API endpoints with clear input/output examples

## Phase 3: Frontend Domain Model Refactoring (3-4 days)

### 3.1 Create Dedicated Domain Module (1 day)
```
frontend/src/domain/
  ├── agent.rs       # Pure agent business logic
  └── workflow.rs    # Workflow orchestration logic
```

### 3.2 Create Canvas Visualization Module (1 day)
```
frontend/src/canvas/
  ├── node.rs        # Visual node representation
  ├── edge.rs        # Connections between nodes
  ├── renderer.rs    # Canvas drawing functions
  └── events.rs      # Mouse/keyboard handling
```

### 3.3 Migrate From Legacy Node to New Structures (2 days)
- Start with simple migration of core agent functions
- Update message handlers to use the new structures
- Test each migration step carefully

## Phase 4: State Management Refactoring (2-3 days)

### 4.1 Split Global AppState (1 day)
```rust
pub struct AppState {
    // Domain models
    pub agents: HashMap<u32, Agent>,
    pub workflows: HashMap<u32, Workflow>,
    
    // Visualization state
    pub canvas: CanvasState,
    
    // UI state
    pub ui: UiState,
}

pub struct CanvasState {
    pub nodes: HashMap<String, CanvasNode>,
    pub edges: HashMap<String, Edge>,
    pub viewport_x: f64,
    pub viewport_y: f64,
    // Other canvas-specific properties
}

pub struct UiState {
    pub active_view: ActiveView,
    pub selected_node_id: Option<String>,
    pub is_loading: bool,
    // Other UI-specific properties
}
```

### 4.2 Update Message Handling (1-2 days)
- Split update.rs into domain-specific handlers
- Create separate message enums for different concerns:
  - `AgentMessage` for agent operations
  - `CanvasMessage` for canvas operations
  - `UiMessage` for UI state changes

## Phase 5: UI Component Refactoring (2-3 days)

### 5.1 Dashboard View Refactoring (1 day)
- Update to work directly with `agents` HashMap
- Remove any dependency on node structure

### 5.2 Canvas View Refactoring (1-2 days)
- Update to work with `canvas_nodes` and optional agent references
- Ensure canvas can work with or without agents

## Phase 6: Network Layer Refactoring (1-2 days)

### 6.1 Agent API Client Module (1 day)
- Create a dedicated module for agent API operations
- Ensure all agent operations go through this module

### 6.2 WebSocket Refactoring (1 day)
- Update WebSocket handling to work with the new structures
- Ensure streaming responses update the correct state

## Phase 7: Cleanup and Testing (2-3 days)

### 7.1 Remove Legacy Code (1 day)
- Gradually remove the legacy `nodes` HashMap
- Update all references to use new structures

### 7.2 Comprehensive Testing (1-2 days)
- Test all agent operations
- Test all canvas operations
- Test agent visualization on canvas

## Phase 8: Documentation and Future Planning (1 day)

### 8.1 Update Code Documentation
- Document the new architecture
- Update comments to reflect separation of concerns

### 8.2 Plan for Future Extensions
- Document how to add new agent types
- Document how to extend canvas visualization

## Timeline Summary
- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 3-4 days
- Phase 4: 2-3 days
- Phase 5: 2-3 days
- Phase 6: 1-2 days
- Phase 7: 2-3 days
- Phase 8: 1 day

**Total estimated time: 14-21 days**

Would you like me to go into more detail on any specific phase, or would you prefer to discuss how to approach one of these phases first?
