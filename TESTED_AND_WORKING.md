# ✅ Swarm Platform - Tested and Working

**Date**: October 6-7, 2025
**Branch**: `jarvis-integration` (21 commits)
**Status**: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND VALIDATED

---

## 🎊 Summary Feature: VERIFIED WORKING

### Live Test Results

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "agent_name": "Quick Status Check",
  "status": "success",
  "summary": "Hello from Jarvis testing!"
}
```

**✅ Summary extraction is ACTUALLY working** - not just coded, but tested and validated.

## 🐳 PostgreSQL Setup (Working)

### Container Running
```bash
$ docker ps | grep zerg-postgres
zerg-postgres   postgres:15-alpine   Running   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp
```

### Connection
```
postgresql://zerg:dev@localhost:5432/zerg
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- All tables present with correct columns
agent_runs:
  - summary (text, nullable) ✓
  - created_at (timestamp) ✓
  - updated_at (timestamp) ✓
```

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: _REPO_ROOT Path (Fixed in 65cddb4)
**Problem**: After monorepo migration, config couldn't find .env
**Fix**: Changed `parents[3]` → `parents[5]`
**Impact**: Settings now loads DATABASE_URL correctly

### Issue 2: Summary Never Populated (Fixed in 095336c)
**Problem**: _extract_run_summary() existed but wasn't being called
**Fix**: Capture return value from mark_finished(), include in SSE events
**Impact**: Task Inbox now shows actual summaries

### Issue 3: Request Import Missing (Fixed in 336c57a)
**Problem**: jarvis.py referenced Request without importing
**Fix**: Added to fastapi imports
**Impact**: Backend starts without NameError

---

## 📊 What's Deployed

### Backend (apps/zerg/backend/)
- Complete Jarvis API router (505 lines)
- Summary extraction logic (working)
- PostgreSQL with advisory locks
- SSE streaming with summaries
- 4 baseline agents scheduled

### Frontend (apps/jarvis/apps/web/)
- Task Inbox component integrated
- Text input mode wired up
- Voice command → agent dispatch
- SSE connection with token
- Intent mapping functional

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL in Docker
- Unified Makefile commands
- Integration test scripts
- Setup validation
- Tool manifest system

---

## 🚀 Commands for Tomorrow

### Start Everything
```bash
cd /Users/davidrose/git/zerg

# Ensure Postgres is running
docker start zerg-postgres  # If stopped

# Start full platform
make swarm-dev

# Open Jarvis
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Test Commands

**Voice**: Say "run my morning digest"
**Text**: Type "run quick status" and press Enter

**Expected**: Task Inbox updates in real-time with summary when complete

### Reset if Needed
```bash
# Nuke database and start fresh
docker rm -f zerg-postgres
docker run -d --name zerg-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=zerg \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=zerg \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15-alpine

# Reinitialize
uv run python -c "from zerg.database import initialize_database; initialize_database()"
uv run python scripts/seed_jarvis_agents.py
```

## 🎯 Known Working Features

### Backend APIs (All Tested)
- ✅ POST /api/jarvis/auth - Device authentication
- ✅ GET /api/jarvis/agents - List 4 agents
- ✅ GET /api/jarvis/runs - History with summaries
- ✅ POST /api/jarvis/dispatch - Trigger execution
- ✅ GET /api/jarvis/events - SSE streaming (with ?token=xyz)

### Summary Extraction
- ✅ Extracts first assistant message from thread
- ✅ Handles string content
- ✅ Truncates to 500 chars
- ✅ Stores in AgentRun.summary
- ✅ Includes in SSE events
- ✅ Returns in API responses

### Baseline Agents
- ✅ Morning Digest (7 AM daily)
- ✅ Health Watch (8 PM daily)
- ✅ Weekly Planning (Sundays 6 PM)
- ✅ Quick Status (on-demand)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Monorepo Path Issues
Moving from `backend/` to `apps/zerg/backend/` broke path calculations. Always check:
- Config file paths
- Migration scripts
- Import paths

### 2. PostgreSQL is Required
Original design decision was correct - don't add SQLite fallbacks, just use Postgres.

### 3. Summary Population
Having the extraction function isn't enough - must capture return values and use them in SSE events.

### 4. Testing in Production
Always test with the actual database system (PostgreSQL), not a fallback.

2. **During day**: Say "run quick status" → instant result
3. **Evening**: Health Watch runs at 8 PM with trends
4. **Anytime**: Type or speak commands, get results
