# Drag-and-Drop Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented drag-and-drop functionality from the Agent Shelf to the Canvas as follows:

1. **Agent Shelf (`agent_shelf.rs`):**
   - Made agent pills draggable with `draggable="true"` attribute
   - Added `dragstart` event handler to set drag data (agent ID and name as JSON)
   - Added `dragend` event handler to clean up the dragging state
   - Preserved click-to-add for accessibility fallback

2. **Canvas (`canvas_editor.rs`):**
   - Added `dragover` event handler to highlight drop area and allow drops
   - Added `dragleave` handler to remove highlighting when drag exits
   - Added `drop` event handler to:
     - Get mouse coordinates
     - Convert to world coordinates (accounting for zoom and viewport)
     - Parse agent data from drop event
     - Create node at drop location via `AddAgentNode` message

3. **Styles (`styles.css`):**
   - Added `.agent-pill.dragging` style for visual feedback during drag
   - Added `#canvas-container.canvas-drop-target` style for drop area highlighting
   - Added optional `.drag-ghost` style for custom drag images

## Testing the Implementation

To test the drag-and-drop functionality:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ./build.sh     # Or ./build-debug.sh for debugging
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your browser (should be running at http://localhost:8002).

3. **Navigate to the Canvas** tab in the UI.

4. **Test drag-and-drop:**
   - Click and hold on an agent pill in the left sidebar
   - Drag it onto the canvas
   - Release to drop
   - Verify the agent node appears at the drop location
   - Check browser console for debug logs

5. **Test visual feedback:**
   - During drag, the agent pill should show a dragging state
   - The canvas should highlight when dragging over it
   - The highlight should disappear after dropping or leaving

6. **Test fallback behavior:**
   - Verify clicking an agent pill still works as before

## Troubleshooting

If drag-and-drop isn't working:

1. **Check browser console** for errors or debugging messages
2. **Verify the DragEvent features** are correctly added to Cargo.toml
3. **Test in different browsers** (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)

## Known Limitations

- Custom drag ghost/image not implemented (potential future enhancement)
- Mobile touch events not specifically handled (desktop focus for now)

## Next Steps

- Consider adding animation for node creation on drop
- Add custom drag ghost image for better UX
- Add touch event support for mobile devices
- Implement unit tests for drag-and-drop functionality
