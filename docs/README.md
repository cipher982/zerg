## Architecture

The main architecture spec is **[specs/super-siri-architecture.md](./specs/super-siri-architecture.md)** - this defines the v2.0 "Trust the AI" philosophy and system design.

Supporting specs:

- `specs/supervisor-ui-spec.md` - UI components
- `specs/worker-supervision-roundabout.md` - Worker monitoring
- `specs/ops_control_plane.md` - SSH security model
