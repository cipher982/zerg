- [ ] Tool configuration modal: advanced input mapping (node outputs), validation, test logic (future)
- [x] Agent configuration modal is robust
- [x] Canvas drag/drop and rendering is stable
- [ ] Trigger configuration modal: modal UI, parameter mapping
- [ ] Workflow execution engine: backend + frontend, live feedback
- [ ] Templates, advanced UX

## Implementation Notes

- All code changes are directly aligned with the requirements and user stories in this PRD.
- The node palette, drag-and-drop, and rendering logic are implemented as described in Epics 1 and 2.
- The hybrid approach for tool visibility is in place, allowing both internal and explicit tool nodes.
- The codebase changes (Rust/WASM frontend, state management, rendering, and palette) are consistent with the technical architecture and implementation roadmap in this PRD.
- Compilation errors and warnings have been resolved; the system is ready for further development and testing.
- The team has standardized on modal dialogs for all node configuration, ensuring a consistent and accessible UX. The sidebar approach was evaluated and rejected due to UX and technical drawbacks.

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Users see Zerg as "another ChatGPT" because they can only chat with agents. The powerful MCP tool integrations and trigger system are hidden behind configuration modals.

**Solution**: Make tools and triggers first-class visual nodes on the canvas, enabling users to build "Zapier + AI" workflows by dragging and connecting components.

**Success Metric**: 80% of new users create their first automated workflow within 10 minutes.

**Key Differentiator**: Transform from "chat with AI" to "visual AI workflow automation platform"

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
- **Hidden Capabilities**: MCP tools configured in modals, invisible during workflow creation
- **No Visual Automation**: Users can't see or build automated workflows
- **ChatGPT Comparison**: "This is just ChatGPT with extra configuration steps"
- **Complex Mental Model**: Users must understand agents, tools, and triggers separately
- **No Immediate Value**: Setup-heavy with unclear payoff

### User Journey Problems
1. User configures MCP tools in agent modal
2. User chats with agent hoping it uses the right tools
3. User has no visibility into what tools are available or how they're used
4. User doesn't understand how to build automation

### Competitive Landscape
- **ChatGPT**: Single conversation, no automation
- **Zapier**: Visual workflows, no AI reasoning
- **Make.com**: Complex automation, steep learning curve
- **Zerg Opportunity**: Visual AI workflows with immediate feedback

---

## 2. Solution Overview

### Vision Statement
Transform Zerg into a visual workflow automation platform where users drag, connect, and run AI-powered workflows that integrate with real-world services.

### Core Principle: "What You Draw Is What Runs"
Every visual element on the canvas maps 1-to-1 to runtime execution:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Gmail     │ →  │ Summarize   │ →  │   Slack     │
│  Trigger    │    │   Agent     │    │   Tool      │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

### Key Value Propositions
1. **Immediate Visual Feedback**: See all capabilities at a glance
2. **Real-world Integration**: Connect to actual services, not just chat
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build sophisticated workflows
4. **Live Execution**: Watch workflows run in real-time
5. **Template Library**: Pre-built workflows for common use cases

## Conclusion

This PRD transforms Zerg from a "ChatGPT alternative" into a unique "Visual AI Workflow Platform" that combines the best of automation tools (Zapier) with AI reasoning capabilities. 

The visual canvas approach makes AI capabilities immediately discoverable and usable, while the workflow execution engine enables real-world automation that goes far beyond simple chat interactions.

Success depends on excellent execution of the visual experience, reliable workflow execution, and comprehensive templates that demonstrate the platform's unique value proposition.

**Next Steps**: Review and approve this PRD, then begin Phase 1 implementation with tool nodes on the canvas.
