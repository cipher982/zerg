# Canvas Visual Enhancement Plan

*Status: âœ… COMPLETED*  Â·  *Completed: June 2025*  Â·  *Moved to completed: June 15, 2025*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Goal**

Transform the agent canvas from a static utility into a visually rich, dynamic, and intuitive environment that aligns with the project's futuristic branding. **ACHIEVED**: The canvas now provides immediate, at-a-glance insights into agent workflow status with full visual enhancements.

## ðŸ’¡ **Inspiration**

The design direction is heavily inspired by the existing branding materials, focusing on a dark, glowing, and data-driven aesthetic. Key references include:

-   **Component Styling & Colors:** `branding/agent_platform_design_system.html`
-   **Status Indicators:** `branding/logo_design_showcase.html`
-   **Animated Backgrounds:** `branding/index.html` & `logo_brand_identity.html`
-   **Connection Line Effects:** `branding/logo_design_advanced.html`

## âœ… **Task Checklist & Implementation Plan**

### 1. Implement Dynamic Canvas Background

-   [x] **Task:** Replace the solid background with a subtle, animated particle field.
-   [x] **Implementation:**
    -   Create a new module at `frontend/src/canvas/background.rs` to manage the particle animation logic (structs, updates, and drawing).
    -   In `frontend/src/canvas/renderer.rs`, modify the `draw_nodes` function to call the new background animation on each frame.
    -   Update `frontend/src/canvas/mod.rs` to declare the new `background` module.

### 2. Redesign Agent Nodes

-   [x] **Task:** Update the agent node styling to match the `card` component from the design system, including a glowing border on hover/selection.
-   [x] **Implementation:**
    -   Modify the `NodeType::AgentIdentity` match arm within the `draw_node` function in `frontend/src/canvas/renderer.rs`.
    -   Update the corresponding drawing functions in `frontend/src/canvas/shapes.rs` to render the new card-based design.

### 3. Integrate Rich Status Indicators

-   [x] **Task:** Replace the plain "IDLE" text with rich, visual status indicators (Idle, Active, Success, Error).
-   [x] **Implementation:**
    -   The logic for status-specific colors and icons already exists within the `draw_node` function in `renderer.rs`.
    -   This logic will be enhanced to draw the new visual styles (e.g., pulsing rings, checkmarks) instead of the simple text and pill.

### 4. Animate Connection Lines

-   [ ] **Task:** Upgrade the static connection lines to be animated, showing the direction of data flow.
-   [ ] **Implementation:**
    -   Modify the `draw_connections` function in `frontend/src/canvas/renderer.rs` to use an animated gradient for the stroke style.
    -   **Note:** This was attempted but reverted due to `web-sys` API issues. This will be revisited in the future.

### 5. Continuous Rendering

-   [x] **Task:** Ensure the canvas continuously re-renders to prevent animation artifacts.
-   [x] **Implementation:**
    -   Modified the `AnimationTick` handler in `frontend/src/reducers/canvas.rs` to always mark the canvas as dirty, ensuring a continuous render loop.

### 6. Agent Configuration Modal UI/UX Polish

-   [x] **Task:** Improve the aesthetics and usability of the agent configuration modal.
-   [x] **Implementation:**
    -   **Removed Close Button:** The redundant 'Ã—' button was removed from the modal header, as clicking the backdrop already provides a close mechanism. This was done in `frontend/src/components/agent_config_modal.rs`.
    -   **Styled Tab Navigation:** The modal tabs ("Main", "Triggers", "Tools") were restyled for a cleaner, more modern look, with a distinct visual indicator for the active tab. The styles were added to `frontend/www/css/modal.css`.
    -   **Unified Form Inputs:** Corrected inconsistent styling on dropdown/select elements to align with the standard text inputs defined in `frontend/www/css/forms.css`.
    -   **Enhanced Save Button:** The "Save" button was updated to use the `.btn-primary` class from `frontend/www/css/buttons.css` for better visual hierarchy.
    -   **Improved Readability:** Adjusted the color of the "No schedule set" text to improve contrast against the dark background.
    -   **Stabilized Modal Height:** Set a `min-height` on the modal content area in `frontend/www/css/modal.css` to prevent the modal from resizing when switching between tabs, eliminating jarring layout shifts.
