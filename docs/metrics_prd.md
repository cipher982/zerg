⏺ Product Requirements Document: Modern Observability Infrastructure 
Implementation

Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of a modern, event-first observability
stack for the Zerg platform, replacing traditional metrics-first monitoring
approaches with a raw-data collection system optimized for WebSocket-heavy,
real-time applications.

Background & Context

Current System Architecture

- Backend: FastAPI with extensive WebSocket usage for real-time agent
communication
- Frontend: Rust/WASM with complex WebSocket message handling
- Key Challenge: Previous API spam issue (GET /api/agents) caused by WebSocket
fallback mechanisms
- Data Patterns: High-frequency WebSocket messages, agent execution events,
workflow state changes

Problem Statement

Traditional monitoring approaches (Prometheus histograms, pre-aggregated
metrics) are insufficient for:
1. High-cardinality data from WebSocket events with user/agent/session
dimensions
2. Retroactive analysis requirements for debugging complex distributed flows
3. Cost-effective storage of high-volume, real-time event streams
4. Flexible querying without pre-defining metric aggregations

Solution Architecture

Core Philosophy: Event-First Observability

- Collect everything as raw events - no data loss from bucketing/aggregation
- Schema-on-read - define queries when needed, not during collection
- Trace-driven - leverage distributed tracing for request flow correlation
- Cost-optimized - columnar storage with automatic tiering

Technology Stack Selection

1. Data Collection Layer

OpenTelemetry (OTel) as universal instrumentation standard
- Rationale: Industry standard, vendor-neutral, auto-instrumentation available
- WebSocket Integration: Custom trace context propagation over WebSocket
headers
- WASM Considerations: OTel WASM SDK in alpha; fallback to manual event
emission

2. Data Pipeline Layer

Vector for observability data processing
- Rationale: 10x performance advantage, Rust-based reliability, zero vendor
lock-in
- Capabilities: Real-time transformation, routing, enrichment without code
changes
- Integration: Receives OTel traces, application logs, system metrics

3. Storage Layer

ClickHouse for raw event storage
- Rationale: Columnar storage, 40x compression, petabyte-scale performance
- Query Performance: Sub-second SQL queries on raw events
- Cost Efficiency: 140x lower storage costs vs. Elasticsearch
- Tiering Strategy: Hot (memory) → Warm (disk) → Cold (S3 Parquet)

4. Analysis Layer

Grafana + ClickHouse Datasource for visualization
- Rationale: Familiar interface, SQL-based queries, flexible dashboard
creation
- Alternative: HyperDX for SaaS experience with ClickHouse backend

Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

Objective: Basic event collection and storage

Backend Instrumentation

# Auto-instrumentation setup
pip install opentelemetry-distro[auto_patcher] opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
opentelemetry-bootstrap -a integrate

# Environment configuration
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=zerg-backend
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://vector:4318

WebSocket Event Correlation

# Custom WebSocket trace propagation
async def send_websocket_message(websocket, data):
    current_span = trace.get_current_span()
    trace_context = {}
    TraceContextTextMapPropagator().inject(trace_context)

    message = {
        "data": data,
        "trace_context": trace_context,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }
    await websocket.send_json(message)

Infrastructure Deployment

# Docker Compose services
services:
vector:
    image: timberio/vector:latest
    ports: ["4318:4318"]  # OTel receiver

clickhouse:
    image: clickhouse/clickhouse-server:latest
    ports: ["8123:8123"]

grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    environment:
    - GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-clickhouse-datasource

Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Week 3)

Objective: Rust/WASM event collection

WASM Event Emission

// Fallback for alpha OTel WASM SDK
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn emit_websocket_event(event_type: &str, duration_ms: f64, attrs:
JsValue) {
    let event = json!({
        "timestamp": js_sys::Date::now(),
        "event_type": event_type,
        "duration_ms": duration_ms,
        "attributes": serde_wasm_bindgen::from_value(attrs).unwrap()
    });

    send_to_vector_http(event);
}

Vector Configuration Enhancement

type = "http"
address = "0.0.0.0:8080"

[transforms.enrich_frontend]
type = "remap"
inputs = ["frontend_events"]
source = '''
.service = "zerg-frontend"
.environment = get_env_var("ENVIRONMENT") ?? "development"
if .event_type == "websocket_message_processed" {
    .is_critical_path = true
}
'''

Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Week 4)
