# `direnv` automatically loads this file when you `cd` into the repo (after
# the first `direnv allow`).  It exports two variables so that *any* `uv`
# command uses repository-local directories for its cache and temporary files.
#
# This solves sandbox/CI issues where `$HOME/.cache` is read-only or contains
# malformed entries, and where the system `TMPDIR` is not writable.

export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$(pwd)/.uv_cache"
export TMPDIR="$(pwd)/.uv_tmp"

# Optional convenience: ensure the cache & tmp dirs exist so first runs don't
# fail if the filesystem is mounted read-only until first write.
mkdir -p "$XDG_CACHE_HOME" "$TMPDIR"

# If you keep helper scripts in ./bin, prepend it to PATH here (commented-out
# by default).  Un-comment if you later add a wrapper script for uv or other
# tools.
# PATH_add ./bin
