"""Failing test for thread‑history subscription bug.

The desired behaviour: subscribing to a thread that already contains
messages should yield a ``thread_history`` payload with those messages.

Current behaviour (before the bug fix): an ``error`` payload is returned.
This test therefore fails – confirming the issue is reproducible.
