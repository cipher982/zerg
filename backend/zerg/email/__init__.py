"""Email provider abstraction layer.

This namespace introduces a *very thin* interface that unifies provider-
specific logic (Gmail today, Outlook/IMAP tomorrow) so that the
``EmailTriggerService`` can delegate provider-specific operations instead of
embedding conditional branches.

Only *skeletons* are added for now â€“ functionality is delegated to the
existing Gmail helpers so behaviour remains **unchanged** while we migrate in
small, reviewable steps.
