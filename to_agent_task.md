ok i would like to start with greatly improving the backend to start. rather than raw openai calls that are just ephemeral for now, we need to begin storing state. such as threads of messages. We can also migrate from this paradigm of raw llm calls to agentic platforms such as langgraph (from langchain) or the newly released openai-agents. It is likely you are unaware of these new libraries, so dont try to write out the specific code, but design a roadmap of how the backend can start to be reconfigured for these upcoming changes."
Below is a suggested roadmap for evolving your backend so that it can store richer agent state (e.g., thread threads, agent configs) and better integrate with upcoming “agentic” libraries like LangGraph (LangChain) or OpenAI Agents. It aims to be framework-agnostic while giving step-by-step changes you can make so your code will be ready to talk to “agentic” APIs whenever you decide.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Foundation: Move from Ephemeral Calls to Stateful Threads
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1.1 Introduce a “Thread” or “Thread” Table
• Create a table in your database (e.g., “agent_threads”) like:
   - id (primary key)
   - agent_id (foreign key referencing your “agents” table)
   - title / short name
   - optional “active” boolean (if you want only one active thread at a time)
   - created_at, updated_at, etc.

• Rationale: Instead of ephemeral calls to “/api/agents/{id}/run,” each user’s thread is stored with a unique thread ID. This makes it easier to replay or resume sessions later.

1.2 Store Each Message in a “ThreadMessages” Table
• Another table:
   - id (pk)
   - thread_id (fk to agent_threads)
   - role: “user”, “assistant”, “system”
   - content: text or JSON
   - timestamp
• This structure means your backend is no longer returning ephemeral text. It’s appending rows for each new turn.

1.3 Update Current Endpoints
• For “POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/run” (or “POST /messages”):
  - Accept a thread ID or create a new one if none is provided.
  - Append the user’s message to “thread_messages.”
  - Call OpenAI (or your LLM).
  - Store the assistant’s response with role=assistant in thread_messages.
  - Return that final message or partial streaming chunks, but ensure it’s recorded in the DB too.

┈┈ This sets you up so ephemeral calls still work, but now each call is optionally tied to a “thread.” ┈┈

2) Agent Config & Memory: Preparing for Agentic Libraries
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

2.1 Expand the “Agents” Table for “Memory” / “Tools”  
• You might add columns/JSON fields like:
  - config: JSON (so you can store any agent-related data, e.g. LLM selection, tool permissions)
  - memory_strategy: string (e.g., “none,” “buffer,” “summary,” etc.)
• Rationale: Agentic libraries like LangChain often want to store “memory” or a “toolset.” Keeping these in your DB paves the way for letting your agent logic read/write them.

2.2 “Agent Tools” or “Permissions” Table
• If you plan to connect external APIs or tools eventually, store that info. E.g.:
   - agent_id
   - tool_name
   - credentials (optional, if storing credentials—some prefer environment variables)
   - allowed_actions
• This is how your agent “knows” which external services it can call.

2.3 (Optional) “agent_state” Field for Real-Time, Pre-LangChain
• If you want to store ephemeral data like “current plan” or “scratchpad,” add a short text or JSON column in agents or agent_threads. Then you can persist partial states for advanced frameworks that revolve around “active planning steps.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) Abstract the LLM Call: Transition from “Raw OpenAI” to “Agent Class”
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.1 Introduce a “BaseAgent” or “AgentManager” Class in Python
• Instead of calling openai.Completion / openai.ChatCompletion directly from your route, create a small “AgentManager” in “zerg/app/agents.py” or similar. 
• This “AgentManager” can:
  - fetch the agent config from DB
  - fetch the relevant thread messages
  - call the LLM
  - store the result back
• Right now, it might just do raw openai calls. But this is where you’ll later swap in “langchain” or the “openai-agents” library.

3.2 Single Endpoints Use This Class
• E.g. “POST /api/agents/{id}/messages” → calls AgentManager’s “generate_response(thread_id, new_message).”
• This unifies how you orchestrate the messages and memory. If, in a few months, you adopt “LangGraph Agent,” you only rewrite the logic inside “AgentManager.”

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) Organic Growth into “Agentic” Libraries
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.1 Decide on Next Steps for Integration
• If you pick LangChain’s architecture, you might replace the “AgentManager” LLM calls with a “LangChain Agent” that has memory, tools, chain-of-thought, etc. 
• Possibly you handle “execute_tool” callbacks from your “AgentManager” to your in-house Tools DB.

4.2 Gradual Migration
• For each thread turn, you feed the last N (or all) messages from “thread_messages” into the agent. If you adopt LangChain Streams, you parse them out the same way. The difference is just your “Manager” might store the chain’s intermediate steps in your “agent_state” field if you want advanced debugging.

4.3 Handling Persisted Memory with Agentic Framework
• Some “memory” classes (like in LangChain) store intermediate thread states in a “Memory” object. You can override it to save those states in your DB. 
• That’s where your thread tables come in: you’re basically hooking your DB as the memory backend for the library.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) Roadmap: Step-by-Step Milestones
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Below is a recommended order for implementing the above changes:

(1) Create Thread & Messages Tables
   - Make “agent_threads” + “thread_messages.” 
   - Adjust your route to create or fetch a thread ID and store messages.

(2) Migrate the “POST /api/agents/{id}/run” or “/messages” endpoints  
   - Instead of ephemeral, always store new message + new assistant response. 
   - Return the final content as normal, but also store it.

(3) Introduce “AgentManager” Class  
   - Move raw openai calls into a dedicated class that loads the thread from DB and returns the next reply.  
   - Keep it simple for now—just “load messages, call openai, store answer.”

(4) Expand Agent DB with “config” / “memory_strategy”  
   - Even if you’re not using them yet, define placeholders so you can store future agentic config. 
   - Possibly store “tools” or “permissions” if you plan to have multi-tool usage soon.

(5) Connect The Dots for Tools or “Scheduled Behaviors”  
   - If you add scheduling, store the schedule in the agent’s config or a “schedule” table. 
   - If you add tools, create a small “tools” table, link them to the agent. 
   - The “AgentManager” can incorporate that data (like “Which tools can I call?”).

(6) When Ready: Swap or Wrap “AgentManager” with LangChain / openai-agents  
   - Once your data model is stable, adopting a new library is mostly a matter of hooking your DB-based messages into library’s memory logic. 
   - Possibly you override library classes to read/write from your “thread_messages.”

Conclusion
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

By storing thread data in a “Thread + Messages” schema, you gain robust statefulness. Introducing a single “AgentManager” (or “Agent Orchestrator”) class isolates your code from raw openai calls, preparing a clean pivot to an agentic library in the future. Expanding your “Agents” table with config/memory fields will let you store richer metadata that agentic libraries often expect. This roadmap ensures each step is incremental—giving you a stable, stateful foundation while remaining flexible for upcoming tools like LangGraph or openai-agents.
