Lets focus on the nodes/canvas. Help me plan this out from first principles what we want to do here. So far the agents are mostly just useful in the chat interface. I have a dashboard with schedule and play
button, but having a hard time figuring out what they should actually do to provide value. The canvas will be a UI to combine agents/nodes/inputs/outputs into workflows, a more directed agent combination. Though
 im having trouble figuring out the WHY, since an agent itself is basically a loop with tool calls right? And inputs/outputs can be tool calls? lets discuss

    Why have a Canvas at all?
    ────────────────────────────────────────

        1. Separation-of-concerns
           • “Reason about what to do” ⇒ LLM Agent nodes
           • “Deterministically do it” ⇒ Tool nodes
           • “Decide where to go next” ⇒ Condition nodes
           • “How the flow starts” ⇒ Trigger nodes
           • “How the result is surfaced” ⇒ Output nodes
              A single Agent prompt *can* ask the model to chain tool calls, but:
           •  Hard to test / debug (hallucinated tool arguments, hidden state)
           •  No branching / parallelism control
           •  Impossible to reuse a deterministic step in another workflow
           •  Costly—every step bakes previous context back into the prompt
        2. Determinism & Observability
              Explicit nodes make each step observable, replay-able and priced.
              Ops teams can see “20 ms HTTP tool failed” versus “the AI broke somewhere”.
        3. Re-use & Governance
              Tool nodes can be permissioned (“finance-export” tool only in HR workspace).
              Same Trigger node (e.g., Github webhook) can feed different agents.
        4. Mental Model for Non-Dev Users
              Most business users think in flow-charts, not prompts.

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    First-Principles Node Taxonomy
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    A.  TriggerNode   (starts execution)
       • webhook, cron, email-received, manual “Play”

    B.  AgentNode     (LLM reasoning)
       • system_prompt, model, temperature
       • internal LangGraph loop for tool-calls (already built)
       • yields ToolCall metadata or plain text

    C.  ToolNode      (deterministic side-effect or fetch)
       • http_request, slack_post, github_issue, vector_db_query, etc.
       • idempotent, <10 s

    D.  ConditionNode (branching)
       • simple JSONPath + predicate or python expr evaluated on ctx

    E.  OutputNode    (terminate or emit result)
       • send e-mail, write row to DB, update dashboard widget, etc.

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Minimal Viable Canvas (MVC v0)
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Goal: prove end-to-end “Webhook → Agent → HTTP tool”.

        1. Node palette with Trigger, Agent, Tool, End.
        2. Single linear path (no forks) ⇒ internally just an ordered Vec<NodeId>.
        3. JSON schema:      { "nodes":[ {...}, {...}, ... ], "edges":[{"from":1,"to":2},...] }
        4. Backend “LinearRunner” executes nodes sequentially, carrying a `Context` (dict).
        5. Each node appends a RunLog row; WS pushes `NODE_STARTED/FINISHED` events for UI.

    Value delivered: users can hit a POST URL and watch the agent reason and a Slack msg appear without opening chat UI.

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Execution Contract (backend)
    ────────────────────────────────────────

        class WorkflowContext(TypedDict):
            trigger_payload: dict
            thread_id: int          # shared conversation
            data: dict              # arbitrary inter-step stash

    Each node implements

        async def execute(self, ctx: WorkflowContext) -> WorkflowContext

    • AgentNode writes assistant/user/tool messages to Thread & returns updated ctx
    • ToolNode writes result into ctx["data"][node_id]

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Frontend Increment Plan
    ────────────────────────────────────────

        1. Week 1 – Visual & Storage
           • Add NodeType::{Trigger,Tool,End} enums
           • Drag-drop palette; straight-line connector UI
           • Serialize to localStorage + “Save” → PUT /agents/{id} workflow_definition
        2. Week 2 – Backend Runner + Trigger Integration
           • SQL migration: Agent.workflow_definition (JSON)
           • `/agents/{id}/run_workflow(trigger_payload)` route
           • Re-use existing AgentManager inside AgentNode wrapper
        3. Week 3 – Real-time UI & Condition Node
           • Stream `NODE_*` WS events
           • Color/highlight active node in Canvas
           • Simple ConditionNode with true/false outgoing edges (if/else)
        4. Week 4 – Parallel edges & basic Tool library
           • Fan-out edges allowed, still join serially
           • Ship two deterministic tools (HTTP POST, Slack post)
           • UI side-panel for configuring each tool

    Keep each week deployable; users get incremental value.

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Definition of Done for each Node type
    ────────────────────────────────────────
    • Can be created on canvas and saved in JSON
    • Has a sidebar config UI with validation
    • Backend executes it, logs start/finish row, exposes failures
    • Appears in real-time run-timeline in UI

    ────────────────────────────────────────
    Open Questions / Next-step Discussion
    ────────────────────────────────────────

        1. Context size limits – we may want node-level `output_key` to prune data.
        2. Do we allow Agent-calls other tools within its own prompt? (Yes, but treat them as opaque sub-steps; high-level graph still shows single AgentNode.)
        3. Error strategy – fail-fast vs skip vs retry node.
        4. Parallel execution – after MVP decide on concurrency semantics.

I want to first make the canvas usable, seems broken for now. I did A LOT of refactors since building the canvas a long time ago. It seems both canvas and dashboard have a create agent button. Maybe we can
remove the create agent button from canvas? lets think how canvas UX should go. Maybe we can have create Node button, then you click the node and select type (tool, agent, etc) then i can select Agent A for that
 node? Or we can have a sidebar of nodes/types, and we drag them onto canvas? like a shelf of agents from dashboard. Then how does canvas work with more than one workflow? do i put them all on a single canvas?
do i have 'pages' or workflows as units of canvas views?

codex
Below is a concrete, opinionated plan for making the Canvas usable again and giving it a clear “reason to exist”.  I’ve split it into Conceptual UX decisions and the incremental Engineering tasks that fall
out of them.

────────────────────────────────────────
A.  Conceptual UX Decisions
────────────────────────────────────────

   1. Source-of-Truth for “Agents”
         •  Agents are created & edited in the Dashboard (or its own modal).
         •  The Canvas **references** agents; it never “creates” them.
         ⇒  Remove the “Create Agent” button from the Canvas toolbar.
   2. How a user places things on the canvas
         Palette-and-Drag is the familiar mental model:
         •  Left sidebar (“Node Palette”): Trigger, Agent, Tool, Condition, End.
         •  User drags a node type onto the canvas (or clicks “+” then clicks a spot).
         •  Selecting a node opens a right-hand “Inspector” panel to configure it.

   Configuration examples:
   •  AgentNode → dropdown of existing Agents (+ “Create new…” link that opens the dashboard/modal).
   •  ToolNode → choose tool type (HTTP, Slack…) and fill parameters.
   •  TriggerNode → shows the webhook URL & secret (read-only) or cron string.

   1. Workflow Scoping (“pages” vs one giant canvas)
         •  Introduce the concept of a Workflow entity (name + JSON definition).
         •  Canvas page always shows ONE workflow at a time; a top nav-select lists existing workflows and a “New Workflow” button creates another.
         •  This keeps each file sane and aligns with future backend storage.
   2. Minimal viable feature set (so the Canvas adds value)
         For v0 we only need:
         •  Edit a linear path: Trigger → Agent → Tool → End.
         •  Save the layout to backend (Agent.workflow_definition column or new /workflows table).
         •  Allow the Trigger’s webhook to fire and visually highlight nodes as they run via WS events.

────────────────────────────────────────
B.  Incremental Engineering Tasks
────────────────────────────────────────
Week 0 – “Un-break & Simplify”

   1. Rust compile: fix all model/struct drift so the old canvas renders again.
   2. Strip “Create Agent” button from Canvas toolbar and associated code paths.

Week 1 – New Node Palette + Drag-n-Drop
3.  models.rs
   •  Extend NodeType enum → {Trigger, Agent, Tool, Condition, End}.
   •  Add config: Value (serde_json) to Node struct for per-node settings.
4.  components/canvas/ palette_sidebar.rs (new)
   •  Renders draggable icons for each NodeType.
5.  canvas_editor.rs
   •  Accept drop events, spawn Node with default config at mouse coords.
6.  Right-hand Inspector panel
   •  Shows Node props; for AgentNode renders dropdown of state.agents.

Week 2 – Workflow Selector
7.  Add Workflow { id, name, nodes, edges } to models.rs and state.
8.  Top bar dropdown “Workflow: <name>  ▼” + “New Workflow” button.
9.  API: create /workflows CRUD routes (or temporary store in Agent.workflow_definition).

Week 3 – Execution + Live Highlight
10. Backend “LinearRunner” that walks nodes in order, re-uses existing AgentManager for AgentNodes.
11. Publish WS events NODE_STARTED/FINISHED.
12. Frontend subscribes & highlights nodes with a pulsing border.

Optional Week 4 – Condition branching & tool library kickoff.

────────────────────────────────────────
C.  Immediate To-Dos (can start today)
────────────────────────────────────────

   1. Remove the “Create Agent” button from Canvas:
      • delete toolbar icon, prune event handler.
   2. Fix compile errors that arose after recent refactors (models.rs → Node struct drift).
   3. Stub NodePalette component that lists Trigger/Agent/Tool icons (static).
   4. When user drags an “Agent” icon in, open the right-hand panel with a dropdown of existing agents (state.agents) for selection; save selection into node.config.

This slice already delivers value: you can visually lay out a Trigger-Agent-Tool chain and associate it with real Agents, even before backend execution is wired.

Let me know if you’d like me to:
• start deleting the Create-Agent button,
• scaffold NodePalette + enum changes, or
• jump into backend workflow model.
