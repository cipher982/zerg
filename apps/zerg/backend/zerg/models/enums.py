"""Shared *Enum* definitions for SQLAlchemy & Pydantic models.

The Enums inherit from ``str`` so that:

* JSON serialisation remains unchanged (values render as plain strings).
* Equality checks against raw literals (``role == "ADMIN"``) keep working –
  important for backwards compatibility with existing test-suite asserts.
