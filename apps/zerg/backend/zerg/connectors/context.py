"""Context variables for connector credential resolution.

This module provides a thread-safe way to pass the credential resolver
to connector tools during agent execution using Python's contextvars.

The pattern mirrors the token streaming context (token_stream.py) where
the AgentRunner sets the context before invocation and tools read from it.

Usage in AgentRunner:
    from zerg.connectors.context import set_credential_resolver
    resolver = CredentialResolver(agent_id=agent.id, db=db)
    set_credential_resolver(resolver)
    # ... invoke agent ...
    set_credential_resolver(None)  # cleanup

Usage in Tools:
    from zerg.connectors.context import get_credential_resolver
    resolver = get_credential_resolver()
    if resolver:
        creds = resolver.get(ConnectorType.SLACK)
