# E2E Test Expansion Plan for Zerg Agent Platform

## Context

The Zerg Agent Platform is a sophisticated AI agent management system with:
- **Frontend**: Rust/WASM-based SPA with multiple views (Dashboard, Canvas, Profile, Chat)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PostgreSQL, supporting agents, threads, triggers, and real-time WebSocket communication
- **Current E2E Coverage**: Only 4 basic tests covering dashboard rendering, scope toggle, canvas agent shelf, and modal tabs

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all major user workflows end-to-end
2. **User-Centric Testing**: Focus on typical user journeys rather than implementation details
3. **Regression Prevention**: Catch integration issues between frontend and backend
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of system behavior
5. **Confidence**: Enable rapid development with safety net of thorough tests

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test Structure
```typescript
// Example test structure
test.describe('Feature: Agent Management', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Setup: Login, navigate to dashboard
  });

  test('should create new agent successfully', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
  });
});
```

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
- ✅ Test user-visible behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Include both happy path and error scenarios
- ✅ Use meaningful test descriptions
- ✅ Keep tests independent and idempotent
- ✅ Mock external services (OAuth, email) where needed
- ✅ Use Page Object Model for complex interactions
